Q1. Find all pizzas eaten by at least one female over the age of 20. 
\project_{pizza} (
  (\select_{gender = 'female' and age > '20'} Person) \join Eats
)

Q2. Find the names of all females who eat at least one pizza served by Straw Hat. (Note: The pizza need not be eaten at Straw Hat.) 

\project_{name} (
    (\select_{gender = 'female'} Person)
    \join Eats
    \join 
    (\select_{pizzeria = 'Straw Hat'} Serves)
)

Q3. Find all pizzerias that serve at least one pizza for less than $10 that either Amy or Fay (or both) eat. 
\project_{pizzeria} (
    (\select_{price < '10'} Serves)
    \join
    (\select_{name = 'Amy' or 'Fay'} Person)
    \join
    Eats
 )
 
Q4. Find all pizzerias that serve at least one pizza for less than $10 that both Amy and Fay eat. 
\project_{pizzeria} (
    (\select_{price < '10'} Serves)
    \join
    (\project_{pizza}(\select_{name = 'Amy'} Eats) 
    \intersect 
    \project_{pizza}(\select_{name = 'Fay'} Eats))
 )

Q5. Find the names of all people who eat at least one pizza served by Dominos but who do not frequent Dominos.
\project_{name}(
    ((\select_{pizzeria = 'Dominos'} Serves) \join Eats)
 )
    \diff
\project_{name} (
    \select_{pizzeria = 'Dominos'} Frequents
)

Q6. Find all pizzas that are eaten only by people younger than 24, or that cost less than $10 everywhere they're served. 
(\project_{pizza}(Serves) \diff \project_{pizza}(\select_{price > '10'} Serves))
\union
(\project_{pizza}(Eats) \diff \project_{pizza}(\select_{age >= '24'} Person \join Eats))

Q7. Find the age of the oldest person (or people) who eat mushroom pizza. 
\rename_{age2}
(\project_{age}(\project_{name}(\select_{pizza = 'mushroom'} Eats) \join Person))
\diff
\project_{age2}(
\rename_{age2}(\project_{age}(\project_{name}(\select_{pizza = 'mushroom'}Eats) \join Person)) 
\join_{age2 < age1} 
\rename_{age1}(\project_{age}(\project_{name}(\select_{pizza = 'mushroom'}Eats) \join Person))
)

When join under condition age2 smaller than age1 we have such 10 19, 10 20, 10 32, 10 13, ..., 13 19, 13 20, but no 32 here.

Q8. Find all pizzerias that serve only pizzas eaten by people over 30. 
\project_{pizzeria} Serves
\diff
\project_{pizzeria}(
Serves
\join
((\project_{pizza} Serves)
\diff
(\project_{pizza}((\select_{age >'30'} Person) \join Eats))
)
)

9. Find all pizzerias that serve every pizza eaten by people over 30. 

#This is the best query I've found. It is also known as division in database terminology.

(\project_{pizzeria}Serves) 
\diff 
    (\project_{pizzeria}((\project_{pizzeria}Serves) 
        \cross 
        (\project_{pizza}(\select_{age>'30'}Person \join Eats)) 
    \diff 
    (\project_{pizzeria,pizza}
    ((\select_{age>'30'}Person \join Eats) \join Serves))))
